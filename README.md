# ObserverStatePattern

Observer patter:

the observer pattern works by having th eplayer subscribe to the movement event in the playerINputHandler. the event is invoked by the handler whenever input is recieved. this method works well because it allows you to change how the player reacts to certain inputs depending on the situation in the game or even remove input by unsubscribing. 

state pattern:
the enemy has a state machine that tracks if they are alive and changes their motion based on that state.

we are happy with out implimentations because they worked well and within the timeframe. we finished everything. the longest part was spending more time than required on remembering rotations and bitwise. spend more time learning those before next time.
